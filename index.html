                  in your home, office or school so that when the shaking starts, you Drop to the ground, Cover your head and neck with your arms, and
                  if a safer place is nearby, crawl to it and Hold On.
                  </p>

                  When the shaking stops, look around. If there is a clear path to safety, leave the building and go to an open space away from damaged
                  areas.
