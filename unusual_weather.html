        <h2> Thundersnow</h2>
        <p>
        Thundersnow, also known as a winter thunderstorm or a thundersnowstorm, is an unusual kind of thunderstorm with snow falling as the primary precipitation instead of rain. It typically falls in regions of strong upward motion within the cold sector of an extratropical cyclone. Thermodynamically, it is not different from any other type of thunderstorm, but the top of the cumulonimbus cloud is usually quite low. In addition to snow, graupel, or hail may fall.

        While rare, thundersnow is common along lake-effect snow in the Great Lakes area of the US and Canada, the midwestern United States along with the Great Salt Lake. Parts of Montana are also hit by thundersnow storms during the spring time.

    During a thundersnow storm, there is a precipitation fall of anywhere between 2-4 inches per hour and wind gusts equal to that of tropical storms. Due to these conditions, visibility is considerably cut down, most of the time to know more than a quarter mile. the speed of these wind gusts cause extreme wind chills and can cause frostbite to quickly set in.
